:1st_place_medal: **Why is React so relevant?**

SSR x SPA
1) **Server Side Rendering**:
- Traditional applications that are rendered on servers.
- Based on static book pages.
- One server request per URL page.
- Direct DOM manipulation.
- State management per page.

2) **Single Page Application**
- React applications.
- Based on components.
- Javascript will generate pages.
- One request.
- DOM is updated automatically.
- State management per component.
