:1st_place_medal: **Why is React so relevant?**

SSR x SPA
1) **Server Side Rendering**:
- Traditional applications that are rendered on servers.
- Based on static book pages.
- One server request per URL page.
- Direct DOM manipulation.
- State management per page.

2) **Single Page Application**
- React applications.
- Based on components.
- Javascript will generate pages.
- One request.
- DOM is updated automatically.
- State management per component.


:leftwards_hand: **React project anatomy**
- package.json: dependencies, project settings (project name, version, description, keywords etc), scripts, browsers list and others.
- index.html: standard page with the tag <link> "manifest" and "shorcut".
- index.js: it will start the app.

:brain: **Things to remember**
- A component is a function.
- We can render components inside components.
- Everything that's inside {} are Javascript variables.
- React components have props (or properties) that are inputed as parameters. Example: property "title".
